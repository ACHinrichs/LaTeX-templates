#+TITLE: LaTeX-Templates

In this repository I collect LaTeX templates, styles and classes I develop
or use frequently. If I am not the author, this will be noted.

* Installation
** Classes and Styles
*** From source (recomended)
If the class is not uploaded to CTAN (I want to upload and updatese
them all to CTAN, but I it may take some time), clone the repository
into a directory searched by LaTeX. (Using TexLive under Linux this
directory could be `~/texmf/tex/latex`, using MikTech under Windows,
this is configurable) and index them (TexLive+Linux `$ texhash`,
MikTech+Windows Refresh teh osurces via the MikTech-Settings as
Admin).
**** Special notes on developtment versions:
I am not always updating the =.cls=-files when developing new features,
so when you want to use developtment-versions (why would you want to do
that?) Proceed as above when installing from source, but after you
checked out th branch =dev= for the class you want to use, run LaTeX (not
pdflatex) on the =.ins=-File. This will generate a new =.sty= or
=.cls= file. Then just proceed as above.

**** Generate Documentation
If the documentation in this repository does not correspond to the latest
version of the corresponding package or class, run the build script.


* homeworkassignment (LaTeX)
This class provides a relatively simple documentâ€“type for homework,
mainly created for assignments at the University during my studies in
Computer Science. 

It features an easy to use sectioning, frequently used packages and
configurations and macros fo mathematical functions and operators,
which I need often.

* cheatsheet (LaTeX)
I figured that the sourcecode of Cheat-Sheets in LaTeX is always a
hughe pile of badly documented code, which is basically identical for
all CheatSheets, so I bundeled it in a class. Just load
=\documentclass{cheatsheet}= and you are ready to go.

Available on CTAN

* beamer themes =projektion= and =polynom= (XeLaTeX)
Clean, simple and modern 16:9 (yes, that is possible) (Xe)LaTeX
beamer themes.

They are developed to match PowerPoint-Templates by Alexander
