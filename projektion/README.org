#+TITLE: Projektion/Polynom Beamer Theme

A clean, simple and modern 16:9 (yes, that is possible) (Xe)LaTeX
beamer theme.

They are developed to match PowerPoint-Templates by Alexander
Bartolomey Git[[https://git.rwth-aachen.de/occloxium][Lab]] / [[https://github.com/Occloxium][Hub]].

* Fonts
** Main Font
I use them with a font matching the specs of Googles [[https://git.rwth-aachen.de/occloxium][Product Sans]], or
[[https://www.1001fonts.com/gillius-adf-font.html][Gillius]], but any (preferably geometric) sans-serif font with a heavy
bold-face should work nicely.

** Code Font
Any monospace font you like, we prefere [[https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/][Fira Mono]]. Please do not use
[[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][Fira Code]] or other fonts with programming ligatures for your
presentations because viewers who do not know them can (and will!) get
confused. 

* Thanks
Many thanks to Alexander Bartolomey for his PowerPoint-Templates and
implementing /polynom/
