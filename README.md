# LaTeX-Templates

In this Repo I collect LaTeX templates, styles and classes I develop
or use frequently. If I am not the author, this will be noted.
## Installation
### Classes and Styles
#### Release
Located on branch `master` just copy the `.sty` or `.cls` file into a
directory, LaTeX searches (eg `~/texfm/latex/` for TeXLive under
Ubuntu).
If you are using TeXLive (under Ubuntu) you may simply clone this repo to that
directory, MikTex is more complicated.
#### Dev version
Run LaTeX (not pdflatex) on the `.ins`-File. This will generate a new
`.sty` or `.cls` file. Then just go on like above.
#### Generate Documentation
If the documentation in this Repo does not corespond to the Latest
version of the coresponding Package or Class, just run pdfLaTeX on the `.dtx`file. 
## HomeworkAssignment
This class provides a relative simple documentâ€“type for homework, mainly created
for assignments at the University during my studies of Computer Science.
